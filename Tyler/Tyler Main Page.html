                <strong>Tyler, The Creator</strong> (born Tyler Gregory Okonma on March 6, 1991) is an American rapper, producer, fashion designer, and creative visionary known for his boundary-pushing music and eclectic artistic style. Emerging as the leader of the alternative rap collective Odd Future (OFWGKTA) in the late 2000s, he gained attention for his raw, provocative lyrics and DIY production. Over the years, Tyler has evolved from a rebellious underground artist into a Grammy-winning musician, blending hip-hop, jazz, and soul influences across albums like <i>Goblin</i> (2011), <i>Wolf</i> (2013), <i>Flower Boy</i> (2017), <i>Igor</i> (2019), and <i>Call Me If You Get Lost</i>.
